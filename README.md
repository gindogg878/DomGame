# DomGame aka Guess the Image game
The game requires 2 players taking turns and clicking on portions of an image area covered 
in a colored filter. As each player takes turns clicking on a portion of the image they uncover 
a small portion of the hidden image and have a chance to guess what the image is. The first one 
to correctly wins.

#Motivation
I chose to create this game because this will be the first game I have coded and any game would 
have been equally challenging at this point of my programming career. I enjoy gaming, and game 
shows, one in particular is wheel of fortune. I hesitated to create that game via coding and 
thought that this would be a good alternative.

#Issues
there are plenty of issues in my first game attempt.
1: the responsiveness of the page is way off.
2: the ability to make sure only one player is playing is restricted.
3: when a player guesses correctly the img should be revealed. It does not.
4. A reset/restart button is not available.
